golang version 1.11 is recommended but 1.10 will work if lib-go-databox installed in you go path.

If go version is less than 1.11 then:
* Install libzmq5 
* Install libzmq3-dev 
* run "go get github.com/gorrila.mux 
* run "go get github.com/me-box/lib-go-databox

../../testenv/start.sh
make start
```

```
make build-amd64 DEFAULT_REG=databoxsystems VERSION=0.5.0
```
